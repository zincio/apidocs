# Introduction

Zinc lets you buy things from popular online retailers, including Amazon.com, with  a single POST request. Zinc also lets you get prices and descriptive information about products from supported retailers.

The Zinc API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs.

1. Make an account at [dash.zinc.io](https://dash.zinc.io/signup).
