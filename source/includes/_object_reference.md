{
  "product_id": "B06XGHJ5H3",
  "quantity": 1,
  "seller_selection_criteria": {
    "prime": true,

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
product_id | String | The retailer's unique identifier for the product. Note that Zinc does not support digital purchases or Amazon prime pantry items.
quantity | Number | The number of products to purchase.
seller_selection_criteria | Object | A [seller selection criteria](#seller-selection-criteria-object) object containing information about which offers to choose when there are multiple offers available. If the seller selection criteria object is not included for a product, the seller selection criteria will default to `"prime": true`, `"handling_days_max": 6`, and `"condition_in": ["New"]`.

## Seller selection criteria object

> Example seller selection criteria object

```shell
{
  "addon": false,
  "condition_in": ["New"],
  "handling_days_max": 6,
  "max_item_price": 5350
  "min_seller_num_ratings": 100,

```

Seller selection criteria allow you to filter multiple offers for a product from a retailer. They give you fine grained control when a retailer has multiple offers for a single product. This happens frequently when third party or affiliated merchants are selling on a platform, such as o Amazon.

The seller selection criteria serve as a series of optional filters to narrow down the potential set of offers to something reasonable. After all the filters have been applied, Zinc will select the cheapest offer that is still available. For example, if `"handling_days_max": 6` is applied, then the Zinc API will order the cheapest offer where the shipping will arrive in 6 days or less.

Attribute | Type | Description

The shipping object gives you fine grained control over shipping speeds on your orders. Typically, there is a tradeoff between how fast your order arrives and the cost of shipping. The shipping object gives you a way to make sure that you don't go over budget and that your order still arrives on time.

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
order_by | String | The ordering of available shipping methods that meet the desired criteria. Available values are `price` or `speed`.

max_days | Number | The maximum number of days allowed for shipping on the order.
max_price | Number | The maximum price in cents allowed for the shipping cost of the order.

  "security_code": "123",
  "expiration_month": 1,
  "expiration_year": 2015,
  "use_gift": false
}
```

The recommended way to pay for purchases on a retailer is by using gift card balance already applied to an account. Gift cards are supported on `amazon`, `amazon_uk`, `amazon_ca`, and `walmart`. To use the existing gift balance on the account, simply pass `{"use_gift": true}` as the payment method object.

To use a credit card, you must include the `name_on_card`, `number`, `security_code`, `expiration_month`, and `expiration_year` fields. For Amazon, you should only have a single credit card associated with an account which should be the same as the card passed in the payment method object. This allows the system to correctly answer any payment-related security questions.

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
name_on_card | String | The full name on the credit/debit card
number | String | The credit/debit card number
security_code | String | The card verification value on the back of the credit/debit card
expiration_month | Number | The month of the expiration of the card (e.g. January is 1, February is 2)
expiration_year | Number | The year of the expiration of the card (e.g. 2016)
use_gift | Boolean | Whether or not to use the gift balance on the retailer account. If true, then the gift balance will be used for payment. Only works for retailers which support gift balance (Amazon and Walmart).

## Webhooks object

Webhooks let you register a URL that the Zinc API notifies whenever an event happens pertaining to your account. When an event occurs, we will send a `POST` request to the URL specified in the webhooks object. If no URL was specified, then a webhook will not be sent. The body of the `POST` request is the standard raw JSON response for that object.

As an example, let's say you have just created an order via the Zinc API. Every time the order status changes, a `POST` request will be sent to the URL that you passed in the `status_updated` parameter of the webhooks object. The body will mimic the response received from the standard `GET https://api.zinc.io/v1/orders/<request_id>` request. A webhook will also be sent if order fails, gets placed, or if tracking gets updated.

Note that the `case_updated` webhook is specifically for ZMA order cases.

> Example webhooks object

```shell
{
  "request_succeeded": "http://mywebsite.com/zinc/request_placed",
  "request_failed": "http://mywebsite.com/zinc/request_failed",
  "tracking_obtained": "http://mywebsite.com/zinc/tracking_obtained",
  "status_updated": "http://mywebsite.com/zinc/status_updated",
  "case_updated": "http://mywebsite.com/zinc/case_updated"
}
```

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
request_succeeded | String | The webhook URL to send data to when a request succeeds
order_placed | String | (deprecated) Synonym for request_succeeded (placing orders call only)
request_failed | String | The webhook URL to send data to when a request fails
order_failed | String | (deprecated) Synonym for request_failed (placing orders call only)
tracking_obtained | String | The webhook URL to send data to when tracking for an order is retrieved (placing orders call only)
status_updated | String | The webhook URL to send data to when the status of a request is updated

You can optionally pass an Array of webhooks instead of a String, and Zinc will hit all of the webhooks.
