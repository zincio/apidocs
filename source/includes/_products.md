# Product Data

Zinc can get product details, product offers and search supported retailers. In general, these calls are tuned for throughput rather than latency. If you need responses quickly, we have [realtime versions](#realtime-product-data) of each call. Also, proper use of the optional `max_age` or `newer_than` query parameters will improve response times.

## Product Details

> Example product details request

```shell
curl https://api.zinc.io/v1/products/0923568964?retailer=amazon \
  -u <client_token>:
```

Get up to date information on the title, description, manufacturer details, item specifics, and more for any product on our supported retailers.

To retrieve product details, make a GET request to the following URL, replacing `<product_id>` with the retailer's unique identifier for a particular product and specifying the request attributes as query parameters in the URL.

`https://api.zinc.io/v1/products/<product_id>?retailer=<retailer_name>`

### Required request attributes

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
retailer | String | The retailer for the product

#### Optional request attributes

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
max_age | Number | A number in seconds setting the maximum age of the response. The data returned in the response will be at most this many seconds old. Cannot specify with `newer_than`.
newer_than | Number | A timestamp setting the minimum time the response should be retrieved from. The data returned in the response will be newer this timestamp. Cannot specify with `max_age`.
async | Boolean | Determines whether the resulting response will be asynchronous. If set to `true`, then the API will not block waiting for a result. Instead, it will immediately return `status: "processing"` and you will be responsible for resending the request until the response is no longer `status: "processing"`. Defaults to `false`.

Get information about all the offers for a particular product, including seller name, item price, shipping price, condition, seller reputation, and more.

To retrieve product offers and prices, make a GET request to the following URL, replacing `:product_id` with the retailer's unique identifier for a particular product and specifying the request attributes as query parameters in the URL.

`https://api.zinc.io/v1/products/:product_id/offers`

### Required request attributes

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
retailer | String | The retailer for the product

### Optional request attributes

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
max_age | Number | A number in seconds setting the maximum age of the response. The data returned in the response will be at most this many seconds old. Cannot specify with `newer_than`.
newer_than | Number | A timestamp setting the minimum time the response should be retrieved from. The data returned in the response will be newer this timestamp. Cannot specify with `max_age`.

## Product Search

> Example product search request

```shell
curl 'https://api.zinc.io/v1/search?query=fish%20oil&page=1&retailer=amazon' \
  -u <client_token>:
```

Get search results from a retailer based on a query term. Results include product id, title, image url, number of reviews, star rating, and price as well as how many results are shown of all available. 

The api is optimized for fast responses so results are paged. That means that if there are lots of results returned by your query, the response will be paged. You can retrieve more results by executing the query again with an increased page number. For example, if querying the first page lists `showing.start` as 1 and `showing.end` as 48 with a total amount of results as `showing.of` = 30000, you can expect 625 pages in total (30000/48). However, keep in mind that query results are not being cached on our server, so executing a query again with another page number could return different results and will also be billed as each query causes new workload. That means your application should allow the showing object for changes with each query you execute.

To retrieve search results, make a GET request to the following URL, replacing :query with a url-encoded query string and specifying the request attributes as query parameters in the URL.

`https://api.zinc.io/v1/search?query=:query&page=1&retailer=:retailer`

### Required request attributes

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
query | String | The query string you want to search for. Must be URL encoded.
page | Number | The page number of the results page (starts at 1)
retailer | String | The retailer you are searching on.

# Realtime Product Data

The calls documented above are tuned for throughput rather than latency, and for most use cases they work well. There are some use cases (for example, catalog expansion) that have strict latency requirements. To satisfy those use cases we have developed a realtime version of our data APIs. To ensure we meet our latency guarantees, we limit access to the realtime api. To get access to our realtime API, contact <sales@zinc.io>.

Expand your product catalog with realtime results from Amazon based on a query term. Results include product id, title, image url, and price.


To retrieve search results, make a GET request to the following URL, replacing `<query>` with a url-encoded query string and specifying the request attributes as query parameters in the URL.

`https://api.zinc.io/v1/realtime/search?query=<query>&retailer=<retailer_name>&nextToken=<token>`

The first page should always return within 4 seconds and will contain 10 results. If you want to show more than 10 results, you should use AJAX to load additional pages for the best user experience. A demo of this can be found at <http://amazonsearchdemo.surge.sh/> ([source code](https://github.com/zincio/zinc-realtime-search-demo)). Note that you must contact <sales@zinc.io> first so we can enable this feature for you.

### Required request attributes

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
query | String | The query string you want to search for. Must be URL encoded.
retailer | String | The retailer you are searching on. Currently, only amazon is supported.
nextToken | Number | Not included for the initial request. For subsequent requests, provide the token returned by previous request.

#### Optional request attributes
Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
includeAddons | Boolean | If `false` addons will not be returned in search results.

### Response attributes

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
status | String | Possible values are `failed`, or `completed`.
retailer | String | The retailer for the search results
results | Array | An array of results for a particular query on a retailer
results.product_id | String | The ASIN of a search result
results.title | String | The title of a search result
results.image | String | A link to an image of the search result
results.price | Number | The price of the item.
results.product_details | Number | Additional data about product if any was found.
results.addon | Boolean | Will be true if the best offer (aka BuyBox) is an addon. Rarely, this field will not be returned which simply means we were unable to determine addon status in timely manner.
## Realtime Details

> Example realtime details request

```shell
curl https://api.zinc.io/v1/realtime/details/0923568964?retailer=amazon \
  -u <client_token>:
```

To retrieve product details, make a GET request to the following URL, replacing `<product_id>` with the retailer's unique identifier for a particular product.

`https://api.zinc.io/v1/realtime/details/<product_id>?retailer=<retailer_name>`

Using the realtime details call is identical to our [normal details call](#product-details) with the exception that `max_age` is ignored.

If a realtime details call hits our cache, the call does not count against your real-time rate limit.

## Realtime Offers

> Example realtime offers request

```shell
curl https://api.zinc.io/v1/realtime/offers/B00K4F45CA?retailer=amazon \
  -u <client_token>:
```

To retrieve product offers and prices, make a GET request to the following URL, replacing `:product_id` with the retailer's unique identifier for a particular product.

`https://api.zinc.io/v1/realtime/offers/:product_id?retailer=<retailer_name>`

Usage and returned data is identical to our [normal offers call](#product-prices).
